# ## HINT: NAME YOUR DATABASE lab.db:
# ## engine = create_engine('sqlite:///lab.db')

# ## 1) Make an animal table with an id (PRIMARY KEY), and 3 columns:
# ## name, number_legs, cute.
# ## Name: String
# ## number_legs: Integer
# ## cute: Boolean

# ## 2) Add 10 entries into this table.

# ## 3) Query the table to find all the cute animals.

# ## 4) Query the table to find all the animals with 4 legs.

# ## 5) Query the table, and delete all animals that are NOT cute.




# ## Extra 1: Use the animal table as a base class to make tables for 
# ## the 10 animals you added. 
# ## Hint: For each animal, what are some columns you would add
# ## that other animals don't share?
